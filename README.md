# bessel_func
Creates a .dat file of a range of values for the Bessel function

Once bessel_func_exec is run, the program automatically creates a .dat file of the Bessel function ranging from values 0.01 - 10 in 0.01 increments.

The Bessel function finds solutions to a 2-dimensional wave equation given in the form of a 2nd Order O.D.E.

This function utilizes series, factorial and exponential functions.
